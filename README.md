# Procedure_Exercises

#### Question 1:
&nbsp;Create a procedure that accept a number to display the triple of its value
to the screen as follow:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triple of ... is ...
<br>Ex:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exec L1q1 (2)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triple of 2 is 6.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exec L1q1 (3)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triple of 3 is 9.
<br>
#### Question 2:
&nbsp;Create a procedure that accepts a number which represent the temperature
in Celsius. The procedure will convert the temperature into
Fahrenheit using the following formula:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tf = (9/5) * Tc + 32
<br>Then display the following:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... degree in C is equivalent to ... in F
<br>Test your procedure for 3 different temperature.
#### Question 3:
&nbsp;Create a procedure that accept a number which represent the temperature
in Fahrenheit. The procedure will convert the temperature into
Celsius using the following formula:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tc = (5/9) * (Tf - 32)
<br>Then display the following:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... degree in F is equivalent to ... in C
<br>Test run your procedure for 3 different temperatures.
<br>Use the procedure of question 2 to check for the accuracy of your procedure.
#### Question 4:
&nbsp;Create a procedure that accepts a number used to calculate the
5% GST, 9.98 % QST, the total of the 2 tax, the grand total, and to
display EVERY THING to the screen as follow:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the price of $...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have to pay $... GST
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ... QST for a total of $...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GRAND TOTAL is $ ...
<br>Ex:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SQL> Exec L1q4 (100)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the price of $100
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have to pay $5 GST
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 9.98 QST for a total of $14.98
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GRAND TOTAL is $ $114.98
#### Question 5:
&nbsp;Create a procedure that accepts 2 numbers represented the width and
height of a rectangular shape. The procedure will calculate the
area and the perimeter using the following formula:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Area = Width X Height
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perimeter = (Width + Height) X 2
<br>display EVERY THING to the screen as follow:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of a ... by ... is .... It's parameter is ...
<br>Ex:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SQL> Exec L1q5 (2,3)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of a 2 by 3 rectangle is 6 It's parameter is 10.
#### Question 6:
&nbsp;Use the formula of question 2, create a function that accepts the temperature in Celsius to convert it into temperature in Fahrenheit. Test your function at least 3 times with 3 different temperature.
#### Question 7:
&nbsp;Use the formula of question 3, create a function that accepts the temperature in Fahrenheit to convert it into temperature in Celsius. Test your function at least 3 times with 3 different temperatures.
